# Mobile Store Sales Performance + Customer Analysis

📌 Business Problem
As a data analyst for a multinational mobile retailer, I was tasked with uncovering insights from 2024 transaction data. The goal: understand which models sell best, how customer behavior varies by region and channel, and what drives revenue across countries.

📊 KPIs Tracked:
- Total Revenue
- Units Sold
- Average Selling Price
- Top Revenue Brand
- Top Sales Channel
- Top Mobile Models by Gender & Age Group
- Most Preferred Payment Type
- Common Purchase Combo (Brand + Payment + Channel)
- Most Common Price Band

🔍 Few Analysis Highlights:
- Apple leads in total revenue, while OnePlus sees the highest units sold.
- UPI is the most popular payment method across age groups.
- Online is the dominant sales channel, especially among younger customers.
- Customers aged 34–41 leaned toward OnePlus Nord 4 and EMI options.
- Pricing sweet spots lie in the $800–$1200 range.
- Apple's revenue dominance is driven by higher ASP and stronger urban adoption, especially in the 42–49 age group.
- Google Pixel models gained traction among 18–25 and 50+ segments, a unique dual-demographic appeal.![Screenshot 2025-05-22 174512-down](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5953b1c-e4f1-419c-b0bd-060c1e42940c)

- Black and blue were the most commonly sold colors, especially in OnePlus and Samsung models.
- White and green saw low traction overall, possibly better suited as limited edition SKUs.
- India contributed most to total revenue (~$7M+).

✅ Recommendations:
- Optimize inventory for top-performing models like Z Fold 6, iPhone SE, and Pixel 9 Pro.
- Focus marketing efforts on UPI users in online channels, this combo dominates.
- Introduce targeted offers for specific age-brand-payment segments.
- Monitor sales trends across price bands to adjust future pricing strategies.
